    <h1> My favorite hobby <br> Reading Books </h1>
      </section>
    <section id=bio >
      <p> I like to read books because they are a source of knowledge. I especially like to read books that are fiction. Some of my favorite authors are Enid Blyton, Rick Riordan and C.S Lewis. Enid Blyton has written a lot of books but my favorite is the series "The Naughtiest Girl" in which Anne Digby has written books 5 to 10. Rick Riordan bases most of his books on mythology, his series "Percy Jackson" and " Trials Of Apollo" are based on Greek Mythology, "Heroes Of Olypus" is based on Greek and Roman Mythology, "Magnus Chase" is based on Norse Mythology and "Kane Chronicles" is base on Egyptian Mythology. C.S.Lewis's most famous books are the series of "Chronicle Of Narnia" which I have read and reread many times. I have over 200 books in my library. I also sometimes borrow books from the library.
